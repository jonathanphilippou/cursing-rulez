# T021: Implement "rulez add" command - Integration with remote rule source (Cursor Directory)

## Description

Extend the `rulez add` command to retrieve rule content from remote sources, specifically the Cursor Directory. This will allow users to easily add community-contributed rules to their projects.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Command can fetch rule content from a remote source (GitHub or similar)
- Command handles network errors and provides user-friendly feedback
- Command can locate rules by name or display available rules if name not found
- Support for simulated offline mode for testing purposes
- Command outputs clear progress information during fetching

## Implementation Steps

1. Create a utility module for remote rule fetching
2. Implement rule discovery and retrieval from Cursor Directory or GitHub
3. Add error handling for network issues, rate limiting, etc.
4. Integrate the rule fetching into the add command
5. Add logging and user feedback for the fetching process
6. Implement local caching to avoid repeated network requests
7. Test the implementation with real and simulated remote sources

## Dependencies

- T020: Implement "rulez add" command - Command structure and argument parsing (completed)

## Notes

For an initial implementation, we might use a specific GitHub repository as the rule source (e.g., the Cursor Directory repo). Later, this could be extended to support multiple sources or an API if one becomes available.
