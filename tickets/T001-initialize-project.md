# T001: Initialize project repository and basic directory structure

## Description

Set up the initial project structure for the "Cursing Rulez" CLI tool. This includes creating the base directories, initializing a Node.js project, and setting up a basic file structure to organize our code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Initialize a new Node.js project with proper package.json
- Create a basic file structure for the CLI application
- Set up appropriate .gitignore file
- Ensure a clean, runnable initial state

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the project directory structure
2. Initialize a new npm project
3. Set up initial .gitignore file
4. Create placeholder directories for source code, tests, etc.
5. Setup basic entry point file

## Dependencies

None (this is the first ticket)

## Notes

This ticket focuses purely on scaffold setup, with no actual functionality implementation.
