# T004: Write initial README.md with project overview

## Description

Enhance the README.md file with comprehensive documentation about the Cursing Rulez CLI tool, including its purpose, installation instructions, usage examples, and available commands.

## Acceptance Criteria

- README includes a clear description of what the tool does
- Installation instructions are provided
- Usage examples for each main command are included
- Command options are documented
- README explains the concept of local overrides
- Documentation has a professional appearance and is well-structured

## Implementation Steps

1. Expand the existing README structure
2. Add detailed installation instructions
3. Document the `init` command with examples
4. Document the `add` command with examples
5. Explain local overrides concept
6. Add a troubleshooting section
7. Include information about contributing to the project

## Dependencies

- T001: Initialize project repository and basic directory structure (completed)
- T002: Set up basic CLI framework (Node.js + Commander.js) (completed)

## Notes

While the actual implementation of some commands isn't complete yet, we can still document their intended usage based on our design. The README will serve as both documentation for users and a roadmap for our implementation.
