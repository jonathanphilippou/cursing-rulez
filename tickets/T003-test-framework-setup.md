# T003: Create test framework setup

## Description

Set up a testing framework for the project to enable test-driven development of future features. This includes configuring Jest, creating test scaffolding, and setting up some initial tests for the existing CLI structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Install Jest and configure it for testing JavaScript in a CLI environment
- Create test directory structure with appropriate organization
- Implement simple tests for existing CLI components
- Configure npm test command to run tests
- Ensure test coverage reporting is available

## Implementation Steps

1. Install Jest and related dependencies
2. Configure Jest in package.json or jest.config.js
3. Create test directory structure with folders matching src/ structure
4. Write basic tests for existing CLI functionality (command parsing)
5. Update the npm test script to run Jest
6. Test the setup to ensure everything runs correctly

## Dependencies

- T001: Initialize project repository and basic directory structure (completed)
- T002: Set up basic CLI framework (Node.js + Commander.js) (completed)

## Notes

This ticket is crucial for enabling test-driven development, which we'll use for implementing the actual command functionality in subsequent tickets.
